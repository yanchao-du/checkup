## Running the Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
npm run test:cov
```

### Run Tests in Watch Mode
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npm test -- auth.service.spec.ts
```

### Run Tests with Debugging
```bash
npm run test:debug
```

## Test Structure

All tests follow the **AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)** pattern:

```typescript
it('should do something', async () => {
  // Arrange - Set up test data and mocks
  mockService.method.mockResolvedValue(mockData);
  
  // Act - Execute the code under test
  const result = await service.method(params);
  
  // Assert - Verify the results
  expect(result).toEqual(expectedResult);
  expect(mockService.method).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedParams);
});
```

## Mocking Strategy

### Services
- All external dependencies are mocked using Jest
- PrismaService is mocked for database operations
- JwtService is mocked for authentication

### Example Mock Setup
```typescript
const mockPrismaService = {
  user: {
    findUnique: jest.fn(),
    update: jest.fn(),
    findMany: jest.fn(),
  },
  auditLog: {
    create: jest.fn(),
  },
};
```

## Test Coverage Details by Feature

### Authentication Flow
- ✅ Login (valid/invalid credentials)
- ✅ Logout
- ✅ Get current user
- ✅ User validation
- ✅ JWT token generation
- ✅ Password hashing verification
- ✅ Account status checking
- ✅ Last login tracking

### Submissions Management
- ✅ Create submission (draft/final)
- ✅ Route for approval logic (nurse vs doctor)
- ✅ List submissions (with pagination)
- ✅ Filter submissions (status, exam type, patient, dates)
- ✅ View single submission
- ✅ Update submission
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ All exam types (MDW, Work Permit, Aged Drivers)

### Approvals Workflow
- ✅ List pending approvals
- ✅ Filter approvals by exam type
- ✅ Approve submissions
- ✅ Reject submissions with reason
- ✅ Authorization validation
- ✅ Status transition validation
- ✅ Audit trail creation

### Database Operations
- ✅ Connection lifecycle
- ✅ Model availability
- ✅ Transaction support (implicit through mocks)

## Edge Cases Tested

1. **Error Handling:**
   - Database connection failures
   - Invalid credentials
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Not found scenarios
   - Invalid status transitions

2. **Validation:**
   - Required fields
   - Email format
   - Password strength
   - Date formats
   - Enum values (exam types, statuses, roles)

3. **Authorization:**
   - Nurse can't access approvals
   - Doctor can't access user management
   - Admin has full access
   - Users can only access own data (except admin)

4. **Business Logic:**
   - Doctors auto-approve their submissions
   - Nurses route submissions for approval
   - Can't edit submitted submissions
   - Can't approve already approved submissions

## Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ **Isolation:** Each test is independent and doesn't rely on others
2. ✅ **Clear Naming:** Test names clearly describe what is being tested
3. ✅ **AAA Pattern:** Arrange-Act-Assert structure
4. ✅ **Mocking:** External dependencies are mocked
5. ✅ **Coverage:** Critical paths and edge cases are tested
6. ✅ **Fast Execution:** Tests run in ~3 seconds
7. ✅ **Maintainability:** Tests are easy to read and update

## Areas Not Covered (By Design)

The following are not covered by unit tests as they require integration/E2E testing:

- **Module configuration files** (*.module.ts) - These are NestJS configuration
- **Guards and strategies** - These require full NestJS context
- **Decorators** - These require HTTP context
- **Main.ts** - Application bootstrap
- **Database migrations** - Tested through E2E tests
- **Actual database operations** - Covered by E2E tests

These areas are already covered by the existing **E2E test suite** (48 tests).

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
- name: Run Unit Tests
  run: |
    cd backend
    npm test -- --coverage
    
- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./backend/coverage/lcov.info
```

## Future Improvements

### Optional Enhancements:
1. Increase coverage to 80%+ by testing edge cases in services
2. Add mutation testing with Stryker
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Add snapshot testing for DTOs
5. Add contract testing for APIs
