## What Was Tested

### ✅ Business Logic (Service Layer)

**assignNurseToClinic()**
- Creates nurse-clinic relationship
- Handles primary clinic flag
- Validates nurse exists
- Validates clinic exists
- Prevents duplicate assignments
- Unsets old primary when setting new

**removeNurseFromClinic()**
- Removes relationship successfully
- Prevents removing last clinic
- Allows removing primary if others exist
- Validates relationship exists

**setNursePrimaryClinic()**
- Updates primary designation
- Atomic operation (unsets old, sets new)
- Validates relationship exists

**getNurseClinics()**
- Returns all nurse clinics
- Orders by primary first
- Handles empty results
- Validates nurse exists

### ✅ API Layer (E2E Tests)

**GET /v1/users/:id/nurse-clinics**
- Returns clinic array with isPrimary flags
- Requires authentication
- Returns 200 on success

**POST /v1/users/:id/nurse-clinics**
- Creates assignment (201)
- Prevents duplicates (409)
- Handles primary flag correctly
- Validates nurse exists (404)
- Validates clinic exists (404)
- Admin-only (403 for others)

**PUT /v1/users/:id/nurse-clinics/:clinicId/primary**
- Updates primary clinic (200)
- Ensures only one primary
- Validates relationship (404)
- Admin-only (403)

**DELETE /v1/users/:id/nurse-clinics/:clinicId**
- Removes assignment (200)
- Prevents removing last clinic (409)
- Validates relationship (404)
- Admin-only (403)

## How to Run Tests

### All Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### Unit Tests Only
```bash
cd backend
npm test -- users.service.spec.ts --testNamePattern="Nurse-Clinic"
```

### E2E Tests Only
```bash
cd backend
npm run test:e2e -- users.e2e-spec.ts --testNamePattern="Nurse-Clinic"
```

### With Coverage Report
```bash
cd backend
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Quality Metrics

## Integration with CI/CD

Tests are ready for continuous integration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Backend Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd backend && npm install
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: cd backend && npm test
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: cd backend && npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Data Management

### Unit Tests
- Uses Jest mocks
- No database required
- Fast execution (~1.6s)
- Fully isolated

### E2E Tests
- Creates test nurse and clinics
- Cleans up in afterAll hooks
- Uses actual database
- Safe for repeated runs

## Assertion Examples

### Unit Test Example
```typescript
it('should assign nurse to clinic', async () => {
  // Arrange
  mockPrismaService.user.findFirst.mockResolvedValue(mockNurse);
  mockPrismaService.clinic.findUnique.mockResolvedValue(mockClinic);
  mockPrismaService.nurseClinic.findUnique.mockResolvedValue(null);
  
  // Act
  const result = await service.assignNurseToClinic(nurseId, clinicId, false);
  
  // Assert
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(result.nurseId).toBe(nurseId);
  expect(result.clinicId).toBe(clinicId);
  expect(mockPrismaService.nurseClinic.create).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

### E2E Test Example
```typescript
it('should assign nurse to a new clinic', async () => {
  const response = await request(app.getHttpServer())
    .post(`/v1/users/${testNurseId}/nurse-clinics`)
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${adminToken}`)
    .send({
      clinicId: testClinic2Id,
      isPrimary: false,
    })
    .expect(201);

  expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('nurseId', testNurseId);
  expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('clinicId', testClinic2Id);
  expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('isPrimary', false);
});
```
