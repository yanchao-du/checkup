# Fix: Dashboard Recent Submissions Link Issue

## Issue
Clicking on a recent submission in the Dashboard shows an empty page instead of the submission details.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Route Definition
**File**: `frontend/src/App.tsx` (line 91)
```tsx
<Route path="/view-submission/:id" element={<ViewSubmission />} />
```

The application has a route defined at `/view-submission/:id` to view submission details.

### Link Inconsistency

**Dashboard** (WRONG - line 191):
```tsx
to={`/submission/${submission.id}`}  // ❌ Missing "view-" prefix
```

**SubmissionsList** (CORRECT - line 189):
```tsx
to={`/view-submission/${submission.id}`}  // ✅ Correct path
```

**PendingApprovals** (CORRECT - line 166):
```tsx
to={`/view-submission/${submission.id}`}  // ✅ Correct path
```

### Result
When clicking a submission in the Dashboard:
- Browser navigates to `/submission/${id}` 
- No route matches this path
- Shows empty page (no component rendered)

## Solution

**File**: `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` (line 191)

### Change Made
```tsx
// BEFORE
to={`/submission/${submission.id}`}

// AFTER
to={`/view-submission/${submission.id}`}
```

## Verification

### Routes Summary
All routes now correctly link to `/view-submission/:id`:
- ✅ Dashboard → Recent Submissions
- ✅ SubmissionsList → Submission rows
- ✅ PendingApprovals → View button

### Backend Verification
Backend endpoints are working correctly:
- `GET /v1/submissions/:id` - Returns submission details
- `GET /v1/submissions/:id/history` - Returns audit trail

### Frontend API
Frontend service correctly calls backend:
```typescript
getById: async (id: string): Promise<MedicalSubmission> => {
  return apiClient.get<MedicalSubmission>(`/submissions/${id}`);
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### As Any User
1. ✅ Log in to dashboard
2. ✅ Click on a recent submission in the "Recent Submissions" card
3. ✅ **Verify**: ViewSubmission page loads with submission details
4. ✅ **Verify**: Patient info, medical results, and timeline are displayed
5. ✅ **Verify**: Back button works correctly

### Cross-Reference Testing
1. ✅ Click submission from Dashboard → Should show ViewSubmission
2. ✅ Click submission from Submissions List → Should show ViewSubmission  
3. ✅ Click submission from Pending Approvals → Should show ViewSubmission
4. ✅ All three paths should show the same submission details
