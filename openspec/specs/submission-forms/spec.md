## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change refactor-submission-form. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements

**Then** the page SHALL display results for 3 tests only  
**And** Chest X-ray result SHALL NOT be displayed  
**And** the page SHALL clearly indicate which tests were performed

#### Scenario: View FMW submission shows filtered tests
**Given** a user is viewing a submitted FMW medical exam  
**And** the submission formData indicates only 3 tests were required (Pregnancy, Syphilis, HIV)  
**When** the view submission page is rendered  
**Then** the page SHALL display results for 3 tests only  
**And** Chest X-ray result SHALL NOT be displayed  
**And** the page SHALL clearly indicate which tests were performed

#### Scenario: View legacy submission with all tests
**Given** a user is viewing an older submission  
**And** the submission formData does NOT contain test requirement flags  
**When** the view submission page is rendered  
**Then** the page SHALL display all 4 test results (backward compatibility)

---

### Requirement: Form data collection respects required tests for MDW and FMW
The system SHALL only collect and validate test result data for tests that are required for the specific patient, for both MDW and FMW exam types.

#### Scenario: Submit MDW form with subset of tests
**Given** a nurse has filled out an MDW form where only Pregnancy and Syphilis are required  
**And** the form displays only 2 test checkboxes  
**When** the nurse submits the form  
**Then** the formData SHALL contain only:
- `pregnancyTestPositive` field
- `syphilisTestPositive` field  
**And** the formData SHALL NOT contain `hivTestPositive` field  
**And** the formData SHALL NOT contain `chestXrayPositive` field  
**And** the submission SHALL be valid and accepted

#### Scenario: Submit FMW form with subset of tests
**Given** a nurse has filled out an FMW form where only Pregnancy and Syphilis are required  
**And** the form displays only 2 test checkboxes  
**When** the nurse submits the form  
**Then** the formData SHALL contain only:
- `pregnancyTestPositive` field
- `syphilisTestPositive` field  
**And** the formData SHALL NOT contain `hivTestPositive` field  
**And** the formData SHALL NOT contain `chestXrayPositive` field  
**And** the submission SHALL be valid and accepted

#### Scenario: Validation allows omitting non-required tests for MDW
**Given** an MDW submission being created has only 2 required tests  
**When** the form validation runs  
**Then** validation SHALL NOT require `hivTestPositive` data  
**And** validation SHALL NOT require `chestXrayPositive` data  
**And** the form SHALL be considered complete with only required test data

#### Scenario: Validation allows omitting non-required tests for FMW
**Given** an FMW submission being created has only 2 required tests  
**When** the form validation runs  
**Then** validation SHALL NOT require `hivTestPositive` data  
**And** validation SHALL NOT require `chestXrayPositive` data  
**And** the form SHALL be considered complete with only required test data
