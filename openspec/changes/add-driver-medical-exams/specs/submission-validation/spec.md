### Requirement: The system SHALL validate fields at appropriate Validation Timing
Fields SHALL be validated at appropriate times to balance UX and data integrity.

#### Scenario: Real-time validation for critical fields

**Then** the system SHALL validate format in real-time  
**And** display format hint (e.g., "Format: S1234567D")  
**When** the field is complete and loses focus  
**Then** the system SHALL validate checksum

#### Scenario: On-blur validation for most fields
**Given** a nurse is entering height, weight, blood pressure, etc.  
**When** the nurse is actively typing  
**Then** the system SHALL NOT display validation errors  
**When** the nurse moves to the next field (onBlur)  
**Then** the system SHALL validate and display errors if any

#### Scenario: On-change validation for checkboxes and radios

1. All required fields present
2. All field formats correct
3. All business rules (exam timing, type-specific requirements)
4. All character limits
5. All numeric ranges
**And** display ALL errors, not just the first one

---

### Requirement: The backend SHALL independently validate all driver exam submissions
The system backend SHALL independently validate all driver exam submissions to prevent data integrity issues.

#### Scenario: Backend validates exam type matches formData
**Given** a submission claims to be DRIVING_LICENCE_TP  
**When** the backend receives the submission  
**And** the formData lacks AMT section  
**Then** the backend SHALL return 400 Bad Request  
**And** error message: "AMT is required for TP driving licence examinations"

#### Scenario: Backend validates exam timing server-side
**Given** a submission is sent with examination date  
**When** the backend calculates exam timing based on patient DOB  
**And** the exam is not within 2 months of birthday  
**Then** the backend SHALL reject with 400 Bad Request  
**And** the validation SHALL use server time, not client time

#### Scenario: Backend validates data types
**Given** a submission has amt.score as a string "8" instead of number 8  
**When** the backend validates the submission  
**Then** the backend SHALL either:
1. Coerce the value to number (if safely possible), OR
2. Reject with 400 Bad Request: "AMT score must be a number"

#### Scenario: Backend prevents SQL injection and XSS
**Given** a malicious user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in remarks  
**When** the backend saves the submission  
**Then** the backend SHALL sanitize or escape the input  
**And** when retrieved, the script SHALL not execute  
**And** the text SHALL display as plain text
