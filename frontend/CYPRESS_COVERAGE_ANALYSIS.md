### 🔍 Potential Enhancements (Optional)

While coverage is comprehensive, here are optional enhancements:

#### 1. Performance & Load Testing
```typescript
// Not currently covered - optional enhancement
it('should handle large submission lists efficiently', () => {
  // Test with 100+ submissions
  // Verify pagination works
  // Check performance
})
```

#### 2. Concurrent User Actions
```typescript
// Not currently covered - optional enhancement
it('should handle simultaneous approvals by different doctors', () => {
  // Test race conditions
  // Verify optimistic locking
})
```

#### 3. Browser Compatibility
```bash
# Currently runs in default browser
# Optional: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
npm run cypress:run --browser chrome
npm run cypress:run --browser firefox
```

#### 4. Mobile Responsive Testing
```typescript
// Not currently covered - optional enhancement
describe('Mobile View', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.viewport('iphone-x')
  })
  
  it('should display mobile navigation', () => {
    // Test mobile UI
  })
})
```

#### 5. Accessibility Testing
```typescript
// Not currently covered - optional enhancement
it('should be keyboard navigable', () => {
  cy.get('input[type="email"]').focus()
  cy.tab() // Custom command needed
  cy.get('input[type="password"]').should('have.focus')
})
```

#### 6. File Upload Testing
```typescript
// If file upload feature exists
it('should upload medical documents', () => {
  cy.get('input[type="file"]').attachFile('test-document.pdf')
  cy.contains('Document uploaded').should('be.visible')
})
```

#### 7. Data Export Testing
```typescript
// If export feature exists
it('should export submissions to CSV', () => {
  cy.contains('Export').click()
  cy.readFile('cypress/downloads/submissions.csv')
    .should('contain', 'Patient Name')
})
```
