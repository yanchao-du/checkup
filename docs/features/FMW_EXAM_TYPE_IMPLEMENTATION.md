# FMW Exam Type Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Six-monthly Medical Examination for Female Migrant Worker (SIX_MONTHLY_FMW) exam type following OpenSpec proposal workflow.

**Implementation Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Proposal:** `openspec/changes/add-fmw-exam-type/proposal.md`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Implementation Scope

### Database Layer
- **Schema Update:** Added `SIX_MONTHLY_FMW` to `ExamType` enum in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Migration:** Created migration `20251030163237_add_fmw_exam_type`
- **Seed Data:** Added 2 sample FMW submissions (1 submitted, 1 pending approval)

### Backend Layer
- **Type Support:** Verified DTOs support string-based examType (no changes needed)
- **Unit Tests:** All 244 tests pass (no changes required, existing tests cover new enum value)
- **E2E Tests:** Added 10 comprehensive test cases
  - `submissions.e2e-spec.ts`: 6 new tests (POST, GET, filter, UPDATE, DELETE, vitals validation)
  - `approvals.e2e-spec.ts`: 4 new tests (filter, list inclusion, approve, reject)
- **Test Results:** 133 E2E tests passing

### Frontend Layer

#### Type System
- `frontend/src/types/api.ts`: Added `'SIX_MONTHLY_FMW'` to ExamType union
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`: Added `'SIX_MONTHLY_FMW'` to ExamType union

#### Form Components
**New Component:** `frontend/src/components/submission-form/exam-forms/SixMonthlyFmwFields.tsx`
- Test results only (no vital signs or physical examination)
- Fields: Pregnancy test, Syphilis test, HIV test, Chest X-ray
- Uses CheckboxField component for consistency

**Updated Component:** `frontend/src/components/NewSubmission.tsx`
- Added FMW to exam type dropdown
- Conditional rendering for SixMonthlyFmwFields
- NRIC lookup includes FMW (similar to MDW)
- Validation excludes height/weight for FMW
- Patient name field shown for FMW (agency exam type)

#### Display Components
**Formatters:** `frontend/src/lib/formatters.ts`
- `formatExamType()`: Returns 'FMW Six-monthly (MOM)'
- `formatExamTypeFull()`: Returns full description

**Submissions List:** `frontend/src/components/SubmissionsList.tsx`
- Added FMW filter option in exam type dropdown
- Display case for FMW exam type

**View Submission:** `frontend/src/components/ViewSubmission.tsx`
- Lines ~186: FMW exam type label
- Lines ~338-375: Test results section rendering (pregnancy, syphilis, HIV, X-ray)
- Line ~453: 'Female Migrant Worker' exam category

#### E2E Tests (Cypress)
**Updated:** `frontend/cypress/e2e/submissions.cy.ts`
- New test: 'should create FMW submission with test results only'
- Validates: No height/weight fields, checkbox fields present, successful submission

**Updated:** `frontend/cypress/e2e/approvals.cy.ts`
- Added FMW to exam type filter test

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Reuse Strategy
- **Component Reuse:** Utilized existing CheckboxField component for test results
- **Pattern Matching:** Followed SIX_MONTHLY_MDW structure for consistency
- **Validation Bypass:** FMW shares NRIC lookup logic with MDW but skips vitals validation

### 2. Test Results Schema
FMW examination contains only test results (no vital signs):
```typescript
{
  pregnancyTestPositive: 'false',
  syphilisTestPositive: 'false',
  hivTestPositive: 'false',
  chestXrayPositive: 'false'
}
```

### 3. Validation Logic
- **No Vitals Required:** Height, weight, blood pressure not required
- **NRIC Lookup:** Enabled for FMW (similar to MDW agency workflow)
- **Patient Name:** Required for FMW as agency exam type
- **Approval Workflow:** FMW submissions can be routed for doctor approval

---

## Test Coverage

### Backend Tests
✅ **Unit Tests:** 244/244 passing (no changes needed)  
✅ **E2E Submissions Tests:** 6 new FMW test cases
- Create FMW as doctor (no vitals required)
- Create FMW as nurse (pending approval)
- Get FMW submission by ID
- Filter by FMW exam type
- Update FMW submission
- Delete (soft delete) FMW submission

✅ **E2E Approvals Tests:** 4 new FMW test cases
- Filter approvals by FMW exam type
- Include FMW in pending approvals list
- Approve FMW submission with notes
- Reject FMW submission with reason

### Frontend Tests
✅ **Cypress E2E:** 2 new test cases
- FMW submission creation (validates test results fields, no vitals)
- FMW filter in approvals page

### Total Test Count
- **Backend Unit:** 244 tests
- **Backend E2E:** 133 tests (10 FMW-specific)
- **Frontend Cypress:** 2 FMW-specific test additions

## Known Limitations

1. **TypeScript Caching:** After adding enum to Prisma schema, TypeScript language server may need restart to recognize new type
2. **Bundle Size:** Frontend bundle is 1.7MB (consider code splitting in future)
3. **Test Teardown Warning:** E2E tests have worker cleanup warning (non-blocking)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Positive Results Handling:** Add conditional logic for positive test results (e.g., pregnancy requires specialist referral)
2. **Test Result History:** Track historical test results for same patient
3. **Bulk FMW Processing:** Support batch submission for multiple FMW exams
4. **Agency Integration:** MOM-specific submission format (if different from other agencies)
5. **Reporting:** FMW-specific analytics dashboard (positive rates, trends)

### Technical Debt
- Consider code splitting to reduce frontend bundle size
- Fix E2E test worker cleanup warning
- Upgrade Prisma config from package.json to prisma.config.ts (Prisma 7 requirement)

---

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migration
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required.

### Rollback Plan
If rollback needed:
1. Revert migration: `npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251030163237_add_fmw_exam_type`
2. Remove FMW enum from schema
3. Regenerate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
4. Revert frontend/backend code changes
