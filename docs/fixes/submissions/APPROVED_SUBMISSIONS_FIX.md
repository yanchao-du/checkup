# Fix: Approved Submissions Not Appearing in Submissions List

## Issue
After a doctor approves a submission, it doesn't appear in the doctor's "Submissions" list.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Backend (✅ Correct)
**File**: `backend/src/submissions/submissions.service.ts` (lines 72-76)

The backend correctly filters submissions for non-admin users:
```typescript
if (userRole === 'admin') {
  where.clinicId = clinicId;
} else {
  where.OR = [
    { createdById: userId },
    { approvedById: userId },  // ✅ Includes submissions the user approved
  ];
}
```

This means the backend API returns:
- For admins: All submissions in the clinic
- For doctors/nurses: Submissions they created OR approved

### Frontend (❌ Bug Found)
**File**: `frontend/src/components/SubmissionsList.tsx` (line 52-53)

The frontend was incorrectly filtering the data again:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: Re-filtering data that backend already filtered correctly
const mySubmissions = user?.role === 'admin'
  ? submissions
  : submissions.filter((s: any) => s.createdBy === user?.id);
```

This double-filtering removed any submissions that:
- Were approved by the doctor
- But created by someone else (e.g., a nurse)

## Solution

**File**: `frontend/src/components/SubmissionsList.tsx`

### Changes Made

1. **Removed redundant filtering** (line 50-51):
   ```typescript
   // Backend already filters by createdBy OR approvedBy for doctors
   // So we don't need to filter again on the frontend
   const mySubmissions = submissions;
   ```

2. **Cleaned up unused imports**:
   - Removed `useAuth` import (no longer needed)
   - Removed `Filter` icon import (unused)
   - Removed `user` from component state

## How It Works Now

### Data Flow
1. **Frontend** calls `submissionsApi.getAll()`
2. **Backend** receives request with user credentials
3. **Backend** filters submissions:
   - For doctors: Returns submissions where `createdById = userId` OR `approvedById = userId`
4. **Frontend** displays all submissions from backend response (no additional filtering)

### Result
✅ Doctors now see:
- Submissions they created themselves
- Submissions they approved (created by nurses)

## Testing Checklist

### As a Doctor (e.g., doctor@clinic.sg)
1. ✅ Log in as doctor
2. ✅ Go to "Pending Approvals"
3. ✅ Approve a submission (created by a nurse)
4. ✅ Navigate to "Submissions" list
5. ✅ **Verify**: Approved submission now appears in the list
6. ✅ **Verify**: Submission shows correct status (e.g., "submitted")

### As a Nurse
1. ✅ Create and submit a submission for approval
2. ✅ Assign it to a specific doctor
3. ✅ After doctor approves it
4. ✅ **Verify**: Submission appears in nurse's submissions list (created by nurse)
5. ✅ **Verify**: Submission appears in doctor's submissions list (approved by doctor)

### As an Admin
1. ✅ **Verify**: Can see all submissions in the clinic
2. ✅ No change in behavior (admin filtering was already correct)
