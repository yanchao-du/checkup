# Navigation Fix - Admin Settings Access

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Issue**: Admin users couldn't see Settings link or access clinic management features

## Problem

When logging in as `admin@clinic.sg`, the Settings link was not visible in the navigation menu, preventing access to:
- User Management
- Clinic Management  
- Doctor-Clinic Assignments

## Root Cause

The navigation configuration in `DashboardLayout.tsx` only allowed nurses to access Settings:
```typescript
// BEFORE
{ path: '/settings', label: 'Settings', icon: Settings, roles: ['nurse'] }
```

## Solution

### 1. Updated Navigation (DashboardLayout.tsx)
Added 'admin' to the Settings navigation item's allowed roles:
```typescript
// AFTER
{ path: '/settings', label: 'Settings', icon: Settings, roles: ['nurse', 'admin'] }
```

Removed duplicate "User Management" navigation item since it's now integrated into Settings tabs for admins.

### 2. Updated Route Protection (App.tsx)
Updated the Settings route to allow both nurses and admins:
```typescript
// BEFORE
<Route path="/settings" element={
  <RoleProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['nurse']}>
    <Settings />
  </RoleProtectedRoute>
} />

// AFTER
<Route path="/settings" element={
  <RoleProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['nurse', 'admin']}>
    <Settings />
  </RoleProtectedRoute>
} />
```

Made the `/user-management` route redirect to Settings for backward compatibility.

### 3. Fixed Default Tab for Admin (Settings.tsx)
Set the default active tab to 'users' for admin users:
```typescript
// Added useEffect to set correct default tab
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.role === 'admin') {
    setActiveTab('users');
  }
}, [user?.role]);
```

This ensures that when admins click Settings, they immediately see the User Management tab instead of a blank screen.

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`**
   - Updated Settings navigation roles: `['nurse', 'admin']`
   - Removed User Management navigation item
   - Removed unused Users icon import

2. **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**
   - Updated Settings route protection: `allowedRoles={['nurse', 'admin']}`
   - Changed `/user-management` route to redirect to Settings
   - Removed unused UserManagement import

3. **`frontend/src/components/Settings.tsx`**
   - Added useEffect to set default active tab to 'users' for admin
   - Ensures User Management tab is displayed first for admins
   - Nurse users continue to see their settings normally

## Testing

After rebuilding the frontend:

### For Admin Users
