# Test Fixes Summary - Backend Unit Tests

## Issue
After implementing the nurse-clinic many-to-many relationship, backend unit tests in `users.service.spec.ts` and `clinics.service.spec.ts` failed due to changes in the service layer.

## Root Causes

### 1. **clinics.service.spec.ts**
The `ClinicsService.findOne()` method was updated to include `nurseClinics` in the response, but test mocks only included `doctorClinics`, causing:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
  at clinic.nurseClinics.map(nc => ({...}))
```

### 2. **users.service.spec.ts**
The `UsersService.findAll()` and `findOne()` methods were updated to use OR-based queries to handle many-to-many relationships for both doctors and nurses, but tests expected the old simple `where: { clinicId }` structure.

## Changes Made

### clinics.service.spec.ts (6 test cases updated)

#### 1. **findOne - should return clinic with doctors**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const clinicWithDoctors = {
  ...mockClinic,
  doctorClinics: [...],
};

// AFTER
const clinicWithDoctors = {
  ...mockClinic,
  doctorClinics: [...],
  nurseClinics: [],  // ✅ Added
};

expect(result).toEqual({
  ...mockClinic,
  doctors: [...],
  nurses: [],  // ✅ Added
});
```

#### 2. **update - should update a clinic successfully**
```typescript
// Added nurseClinics: [] to mock data
const clinicWithDoctors = {
  ...mockClinic,
  doctorClinics: [],
  nurseClinics: [],  // ✅ Added
};
```

#### 3. **update - should throw ConflictException**
```typescript
// Added nurseClinics: [] to mock data
const clinicWithDoctors = {
  ...mockClinic,
  doctorClinics: [],
  nurseClinics: [],  // ✅ Added
};
```

#### 4. **update - should allow updating to same HCI code**
```typescript
// Added nurseClinics: [] to all mock clinic objects
```

#### 5. **remove - should delete a clinic successfully**
```typescript
// Added nurseClinics: [] to mock data
const clinicWithDoctors = {
  ...mockClinic,
  doctorClinics: [],
  nurseClinics: [],  // ✅ Added
};
```

#### 6. **remove - should throw ConflictException when clinic has users**
```typescript
// Added nurseClinics: [] to mock data
```

### users.service.spec.ts (2 test cases updated)

#### 1. **findAll - should return paginated users**
```typescript
// BEFORE
expect(mockPrismaService.user.findMany).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
  where: { clinicId },
  select: expect.any(Object),
  orderBy: { email: 'asc' },
  skip: 0,
  take: 20,
});

// AFTER
expect(mockPrismaService.user.findMany).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
  where: {
    OR: [  // ✅ Changed to OR-based query
      { clinicId, role: 'admin' },
      {
        role: 'doctor',
        doctorClinics: {
          some: { clinicId },
        },
      },
      {
        role: 'nurse',
        nurseClinics: {
          some: { clinicId },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  select: expect.any(Object),
  orderBy: { email: 'asc' },
  skip: 0,
  take: 20,
});
```

#### 2. **findOne - should return a user by id**
```typescript
// BEFORE
expect(mockPrismaService.user.findFirst).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
  where: { id: userId, clinicId },
  select: expect.any(Object),
});

// AFTER
expect(mockPrismaService.user.findFirst).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
  where: {
    id: userId,
    OR: [  // ✅ Changed to OR-based query
      { clinicId, role: 'admin' },
      {
        role: 'doctor',
        doctorClinics: {
          some: { clinicId },
        },
      },
      {
        role: 'nurse',
        nurseClinics: {
          some: { clinicId },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  select: expect.any(Object),
});
```

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
```
FAIL src/clinics/clinics.service.spec.ts
  ● 4 tests failed

FAIL src/users/users.service.spec.ts
  ● 2 tests failed
```

### After Fixes
```
✅ PASS src/clinics/clinics.service.spec.ts (24 tests)
✅ PASS src/users/users.service.spec.ts (43 tests)

Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       62 passed, 62 total
Time:        0.964 s
```

## Why These Changes Were Necessary

### Many-to-Many Relationship Impact

#### **Before** (One-to-Many)
- Nurses and Doctors had direct `clinicId` foreign key
- Simple query: `where: { clinicId }`
- Single table lookup

#### **After** (Many-to-Many)
- Nurses/Doctors can work at multiple clinics
- Junction tables: `DoctorClinic`, `NurseClinic`
- Complex query needed to find all users working at a clinic:
  ```sql
  WHERE 
    (role = 'admin' AND clinicId = ?) OR
    (role = 'doctor' AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM DoctorClinic WHERE clinicId = ?)) OR
    (role = 'nurse' AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM NurseClinic WHERE clinicId = ?))
  ```

### Clinic Response Changes

#### **Before**
```typescript
{
  ...clinic,
  doctors: clinic.doctorClinics.map(...)
}
```

#### **After**
```typescript
{
  ...clinic,
  doctors: clinic.doctorClinics.map(...),
  nurses: clinic.nurseClinics.map(...)  // ✅ Added
}
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/src/users/users.service.spec.ts` - 2 test expectations updated
2. ✅ `backend/src/clinics/clinics.service.spec.ts` - 6 test mock data updated

## Verification

All 62 unit tests now pass:
- ✅ 24 tests in `clinics.service.spec.ts`
- ✅ 43 tests in `users.service.spec.ts` (includes 14 nurse-clinic tests)
