# OpenSpec Setup Complete ✅

## What Just Happened

I've set up the OpenSpec spec-driven development system for your CheckUp project! Here's what was done:

### 1. ✅ Populated `openspec/project.md`

Your project context file now contains comprehensive information:

- **Purpose**: Medical examination portal for Singapore clinics
- **Tech Stack**: Complete frontend (React/Vite) and backend (NestJS/PostgreSQL) details
- **Conventions**: Code style, naming, commit messages, architecture patterns
- **Testing**: Backend (Jest) and frontend (Cypress) strategies
- **Domain Context**: Singapore medical exam types, roles, workflow states
- **Current State**: List of completed features and planned features

**Location**: `/Users/yanchaodu/workspace/CheckUp/openspec/project.md`

### 2. 📚 Created Workflow Guide

A comprehensive guide that explains:

- What OpenSpec is and why you'd use it
- The 3-stage workflow (Create → Implement → Archive)
- When to create proposals vs. when to skip them
- All CLI commands with examples
- How to work with AI assistants using OpenSpec
- A complete example (CorpPass authentication proposal)
- Best practices and quick reference

**Location**: `/Users/yanchaodu/workspace/CheckUp/OPENSPEC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`

## OpenSpec Workflow Summary

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 1: CREATING CHANGES           │
│ - Review current state              │
│ - Create proposal with unique ID    │
│ - Write spec deltas                 │
│ - Validate & get approval           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 2: IMPLEMENTING CHANGES       │
│ - Read proposal/design/tasks        │
│ - Implement step-by-step            │
│ - Update checklist                  │
│ - Test & verify                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 3: ARCHIVING CHANGES          │
│ - Move to archive/ with date        │
│ - Update specs/ with final state    │
│ - Validate & commit                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Essential CLI Commands

```bash
# View current state
openspec list                  # Active changes
openspec list --specs          # Current capabilities

# Show details
openspec show [change-id]      # View proposal
openspec diff [change-id]      # See spec differences

# Validate
openspec validate [change-id] --strict

# After deployment
openspec archive [change-id]
```

## When to Use OpenSpec

### ✅ CREATE PROPOSAL FOR:
- New features (e.g., CorpPass integration)
- Breaking changes (API, schema)
- Architecture changes
- Performance optimizations that change behavior

### ❌ NO PROPOSAL NEEDED FOR:
- Bug fixes (restoring intended behavior)
- Typos, formatting
- Dependency updates (non-breaking)
- Config changes

## Next Steps - Choose Your Adventure

### Option 1: Create Your First Change Proposal

Ask me:
> "I want to add CorpPass authentication to replace email/password login. Please create an OpenSpec change proposal for this feature."

I will:
1. Create `openspec/changes/add-corppass-auth/` directory
2. Write `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, and spec deltas
3. Validate the proposal
4. Share it for your review

### Option 2: Explore Existing Changes

Ask me:
> "What active OpenSpec changes are currently in the project?"

I will:
1. Run `openspec list`
2. Show you any existing proposals
3. Explain what each one does

### Option 3: Learn More About OpenSpec

Ask me:
> "Please explain the differences between specs/ and changes/ directories in OpenSpec."

Or:
> "Show me an example of a spec delta with ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED sections."

### Option 4: Start with Something Smaller

Ask me:
> "I want to add email notifications when a submission is approved. Please create an OpenSpec change proposal."

This is a smaller, well-scoped change perfect for learning the workflow.

## How AI Will Work with You

### Before OpenSpec
**You**: "Add CorpPass login"  
**AI**: *Implements code directly* 😬

### With OpenSpec
**You**: "Add CorpPass login. Please create an OpenSpec proposal."  
**AI**: 
1. Creates detailed proposal explaining WHY, WHAT, IMPACT
2. Writes spec deltas showing exact requirements
3. Creates tasks checklist with all implementation steps
4. Validates proposal structure
5. **Waits for your approval** ✋
6. Only then implements, following the plan exactly

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear plan before coding
- ✅ No scope creep
- ✅ Documented decisions
- ✅ Easy to review
- ✅ Historical record

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. ✅ `OPENSPEC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Complete workflow guide
2. ✅ `OPENSPEC_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

### Modified
1. ✅ `openspec/project.md` - Populated with CheckUp project details

### Existing (from openspec init)
- `openspec/AGENTS.md` - AI instructions (read by AI automatically)
- `openspec/specs/` - Current capabilities (empty, will be populated)
- `openspec/changes/` - Change proposals (empty, ready for first proposal)

## Quick Start - Try It Now!

Pick one:

**1. CorpPass Integration** (Complex feature):
> "I want to add CorpPass authentication. Please create an OpenSpec change proposal."

**2. Email Notifications** (Medium feature):
> "I want to add email notifications when submissions are approved. Please create an OpenSpec change proposal."

**3. Export to Excel** (Smaller feature):
> "I want to add the ability to export submission lists to Excel. Please create an OpenSpec change proposal."

**4. Just Explore**:
> "Show me what's in the openspec/ directory and explain each part."

## Questions?

Ask me anything:
- "Explain the difference between specs/ and changes/"
- "When should I create a design.md file?"
- "How do I archive a change after deployment?"
- "Show me an example scenario in a spec delta"
- "What's the best change-id naming convention?"
