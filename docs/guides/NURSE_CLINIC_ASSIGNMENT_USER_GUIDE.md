## Tips & Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Set Primary Thoughtfully**
   - Primary clinic should be where the nurse works most
   - Used as default for new submissions
   - Consider geographic proximity

2. **Multi-Clinic Assignments**
   - Only assign nurses to clinics where they actively work
   - Too many assignments can be confusing
   - Review assignments quarterly

3. **Bulk Changes**
   - If reassigning many nurses, do one at a time
   - Verify each change before moving to next
   - Toast notifications confirm each action

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Before removing a nurse from a clinic, check their submission history
   - Consider if they need continued access to past submissions
   - Communicate changes to the nurse beforehand
